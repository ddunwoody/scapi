SCAPI - The Secure Computation API
==================================

What is SCAPI?
--------------

SCAPI is an open-source Java library for implementing secure two-party and multiparty computation protocols (SCAPI stands for the "Secure Computation API"). It provides a reliable, efficient, and highly flexible cryptographic infrastructure.

The latest release is 2.3.0 and can be found [here](http://crypto.biu.ac.il/downloads-scapi.php).
Alternately you can simply [clone the repository](http://scapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#installing-scapi-from-source-on-unix-based-operating-systems) to get the latest and greatest.

Where are the docs?
-------------------

Go to [http://scapi.readthedocs.org/](http://scapi.readthedocs.org/) 
for a prebuilt version of the current documentation. 
Otherwise build them yourself from the sphinx sources in the docs folder.

We also added the javadoc reference under docs/javadoc/ directory, and you can view it online [here](http://crypto.biu.ac.il/scapi/SCAPI_Javadoc_V2.3.0/SCAPI_Javadoc_V2.3.0/index.html).

More information about SCAPI and the motivation behind it appears in this [paper](http://crypto.biu.ac.il/scapi/scapi.pdf).

What if I need help?
--------------------

See the [documentation](http://scapi.readthedocs.org/) for explanations, but if you get stuck we are always happy to help. Email us at [scapi@biu.ac.il](mailto:scapi@biu.ac.il) with any questions you have.

Contributing to SCAPI
---------------------

We will be very happy to receive contributions of [new code](https://github.com/cryptobiu/scapi/pulls) that extends SCAPI (under the condition that it is cleanly written, well documented, and fits into the SCAPI design paradigm). 

We also encourage you to open new [issues](https://github.com/cryptobiu/scapi/issues) and let us know of any problems you find, or any new features you feel are necessary.
